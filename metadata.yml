Title: Projections against Coconut
Description: This tool performs PCA, UMAP and tSNE projections taking the Coconut
  natural products database as a chemical space of reference. The Ersilia Compound
  Embeddings are used as descriptors. Four PCA components and two UMAP and tSNE components
  are returned.
